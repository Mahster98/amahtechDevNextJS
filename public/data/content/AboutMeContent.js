    bio: "I am a Software Engineer in Training based currently in Calgary, Alberta. My career has enabled me to learn a multitude of skills and technologies. I’m skilled in full stack design, from frontend technologies such as Angular and React, to backend tools like Node.js. Along with scripting languages such as JavaScript and Bash, I’m also proficient in object-oriented languages including C/C++ and Java. I’ve also had the pleasure of developing native Apple iOS applications with Swift! I love computers and appreciate being able to create programs to make my life easier. When I am not in front of a computer, I enjoy spending my free time cooking in the kitchen. Similar with programming, I relish seeing my hard work, attention to detail, and effort transformed into something fantastic (and tasty)!",
